### Part 1

```
Given I am on the index (`/#/`) page
When I click "New Kitten" in the navigation bar
Then a form is displayed (on a new route - `/#/new`)
When I enter the name of the kitten
And I enter an image url for the kitten
And I enter a bio for that kitten
When I click the "Create Kitten" button
Then the kitten is listed on the index page (`/#/`)
And the list displays a thumbnail of the kitten image
And the name of the kitten
And the kitten bio
And the number of likes a kitten has
